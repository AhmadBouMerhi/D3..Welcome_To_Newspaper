This project is analyzing the data visualization for a major metro paper. The target is to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. 
The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

The project creates a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques, the project creates a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

Note: You should use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
